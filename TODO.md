# TODO: Revert Color Changes

## Tasks

- [x] Revert color constants in `lib/constants/app_constants.dart` to original colors
- [x] Revert gradient backgrounds in all screens to original blue/pink gradients
- [x] Revert color picker in `lib/widgets/drawing_canvas.dart` to original colors
- [x] Revert tab button colors in `lib/screens/create_note_screen.dart` to original blue

## Notes

- All color changes have been reverted back to the original state before any modifications
- The app now uses the original color scheme with blue/pink gradients and bright colors for UI elements
